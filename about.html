        <div id = "aboutInfo">Hey there! I am Priya Raghuvir. Born and raised in Chennai, India, and now living in Silicon Valley, California. My friends and family always teased me that I was born with anklets on my feet. I lived and breathed dance and nothing but dance. Never did I imagine that these dancing fingers would hold a ladle. Time, necessity, and life change perspectives. Little did I realize, cooking is an art form by itself and requires greater precision and creativity, and culminates in greater joy than what words can express. Now, I am passionate about creating and sharing traditional Indian dishes with exciting flavors and ingredients that are reflective of my upbringing and heritage. My approach to cooking is simple and enticing with the use of earthy spices and fresh herbs & blends that are synonymous with Chennai. My secret ingredient in cooking is always love! </div>
